Level Design

- Things should be worth different amounts
- Getting over the scaffolding is a good challenge

- Handling not sensitive enough
- Acceleration felt laggy
- Drifting too much - fishtailing
- Too difficult to manoeuvre in maintenance area
- camera goes behind a wall in the maintenance room both

- first thought it was button interaction, then realised vases broke, quickly realised you have to “catch” vases - not that obvious, but still figure it out
- Good amount of sensitivity
- Level Design
- Good placement – no issues

Gameplay

- difficulty obtaining successful outcome - kept getting stuck at the exit
- difficult to do in the time remaining - never completed

## Evaluation 5

Driving Mechanics

- turning is too sensitive
- Deceleration could be quicker

- Looting is easy

Level Design

- Walls stop the car too abruptly – maybe make them bounce

Gameplay
